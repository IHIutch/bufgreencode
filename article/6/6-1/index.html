<ol>
  <li>All principal uses must comply with the standards of this section.</li>
  <li>Table 6A: Principal Uses identifies the uses allowed by zone, with cross-references for use definitions and use-specific standards that may apply. The key for the use table is as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>Permitted (4) indicates that the use is permitted by right in the zone.</li>
      <li>Special Use (2) indicates that the use requires a special use permit.</li>
      <li>If a cell is blank, this indicates that the use is not permitted in the zone.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Overlay Zones. Overlay zones (i.e., N-DER, Downtown Entertainment Review Overlay; C-M, Metro Rail; and C-W, Waterfront) are not listed in Table 6A. Whether a use is allowed, allowed with a special use permit, or not allowed is addressed by the underlying zone. For any use standards
or restrictions that may apply to an overlay zone, refer to the applicable overlay zone section of this Ordinance.</li>
  <li>Unlisted Uses
    <ol>
      <li>If a use is not listed but is similar in nature and impact to a use that is listed in Table 6A, the Zoning Administrator may interpret the use as permitted in accordance with Section 11.3.11.</li>
      <li>If a use is not listed and cannot be interpreted as similar in nature and impact to a use that is listed in Table 6A, the use is deemed prohibited.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Multiple Principal Uses. A site may contain more than one principal use, so long as each principal use is allowed in the zone.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Neighborhood Shops. An applicant is eligible to apply for a special use permit to establish or expand a commercial use in the N-2R or N-3R zone where the below criteria are met, irrespective of the limitations of Table 6A: Principal Uses. These criteria are intended to allow existing commercial buildings in residential zones to be utilized to incubate small businesses and artisans in order to serve as catalysts for neighborhood revitalization, as a tool for economic development, and as an important component of the walkability of a neighborhood.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The use is limited to any of the following:</p>

        <ol>

          <li>Retail and service, general.</li>
          <li>Tavern.</li>

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The use does not include the sale, transfer, or lease of firearms and/or firearm accessories, including ammunition.</li>
      <li>The use will not exceed 2,500 square feet in gross floor area.</li>
      <li>The use will occupy a principal building built prior to the year 1953; which was built or modified to include a ground-floor commercial space that faces, and is directly accessible from, the adjacent public right-of- way; and where it can be shown that a lawful commercial use occupies, or previously occupied, the ground-floor commercial space.</li>
      <li>The use will be conducted wholly within a fully-enclosed building.</li>
      <li>The use will occupy a principal structure that will conform to the transparency and pedestrian access standards of the commercial block, shopfront, or shopfront house building type, whichever is most applicable.</li>
      <li>Any nonconforming sign, outdoor lighting, fence, or parking lot will be brought into conformance with this Ordinance prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Delaware Avenue and North Street Exceptions. The use of a property as a residential care facility, lodge/private club, funeral services facility, medical clinic, or professional office is allowed by right on any parcel which abuts North Street, between Main Street and Symphony Circle, and Delaware Avenue, between North Street and Gates Circle, irrespective of the limitations of Table 6A: Principal Uses.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Industrial/Non-Industrial Land Use Compatibility</p>

    <ol>
      <li>This section is intended to ensure a wide range of industrial land uses, encourage employment opportunities, limit the encroachment of incompatible uses into areas adjacent to lands zoned for heavy industrial use, and protect other uses from the impacts and hazards which could result if such uses were established near areas zoned for heavy industrial use.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Any use that occupies any portion of a parcel that is located within 500 feet of a D-IH zone and that is not listed below, but is otherwise allowed by right or with a special use permit per Table 6A, requires a special use permit subject to the additional approval criteria of this section.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The proposed use will avoid, minimize, or offset any potential adverse impact upon, or conflict with the operations of, adjacent industrial uses.</li>
          <li>The proposed use will not reasonably be expected to increase the risk or danger to life or property due to the proximity to adjacent industrial uses.</li>
          <li>The proposed use will be screened and buffered, where necessary, to mitigate against any potential impact upon site users due to the proximity of adjacent industrial uses, including, but not limited to, noise, heat, glare, dust, smoke, fumes, odors, and vibration.</li>
          <li>The proposed use will be served by, or provide, safe and adequate access to and within the site for pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders, the mobility impaired, and motorists.</li>
          <li>The proposed use be will established, maintained, and operated so as to avoid, minimize, or offset any potential conflicts with adjacent industrial uses due to traffic congestion, dangerous traffic movements, or interference with the safe and efficient movement of freight.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>All uses must meet any applicable federal, state, and local requirements, including, but not limited to, licensing, health, safety, and building and fire code requirements.</li>
