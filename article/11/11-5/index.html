<h2 id="1155-pre-application-conference">11.5.5 Pre-Application Conference</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The purpose of the pre-application conference is to make advice and assistance available to the applicant before preparation of the preliminary plat. The Zoning Administrator may include other relevant City departments and interested agencies in the pre-application conference.</li>
  <li>The pre-application conference does not require formal application or fee. Any opinions or advice provided are not binding with respect to any official action that may be taken on the subsequent preliminary plat.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1156-procedure">11.5.6 Procedure</h2>

<ol>
  <li>A pre-application conference with the Zoning Administrator is required prior to the filing of a preliminary plat in the case of a major subdivision, and is optional in the case of a minor subdivision.</li>
  <li>Minor Subdivision
    <ol>
      <li>Only a preliminary plat is required for a minor subdivision application. Once approved, the preliminary plat will be considered the final plat.</li>
      <li>A preliminary plat must be filed, including payment of the applicable fee, with the Zoning Administrator in accordance with Section 11.2.1. Once it is determined that the preliminary plat is complete, the Zoning Administrator must forward the application to the City Planning Board.</li>
      <li>Within 62 days of the determination of completeness, the City Planning Board must hold a public hearing on the proposed preliminary plat. Notice of the public hearing is required in accordance with Section 11.2.2.</li>
      <li>Within 62 days of the closing of the public hearing, the City Planning Board must approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the application. The failure of the City Planning Board to act within 62 days of the closing of the public hearing will be deemed an approval of the application as submitted, except where this 62 day period is extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the City Planning Board.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Major Subdivision
    <ol>
      <li>A preliminary plat must be filed, including payment of the applicable fee, with the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the requirements in Section 11.2.1. Once it is determined that the preliminary plat is complete, the Zoning Administrator must forward the application to the City Planning Board.</li>
      <li>Within 62 days of the determination of completeness, the City Planning Board must hold a public hearing on the proposed preliminary plat. Notice of the public hearing is required in accordance with Section 11.2.2.</li>
      <li>Within 62 days of the closing of the public hearing, the City Planning Board must approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the preliminary plat. The failure of the City Planning Board to act within 62 days of the closing of the public hearing will be deemed an approval of the application as submitted, except where this 62 day period is extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the City Planning Board. Approval of the preliminary plat does not constitute approval of the final plat.</li>
      <li>Within 180 days of approval by the City Planning Board of the preliminary plat, the applicant must submit a final plat to the Zoning Administrator in accordance with Section 11.2.1. Once it is determined that the final plat is complete, the Zoning Administrator must forward the application to the City Planning Board.</li>
      <li>Upon the determination of completeness for the final plat, the City Planning Board will make a determination of whether the final plat is in substantial agreement with the approved preliminary plat.
        <ol>
          <li>If the City Planning Board determines that the final plat is in substantial agreement with the preliminary plat, no additional public hearing is required. Within 62 days of the determination of completeness, the City Planning Board must approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the application. The failure of the City Planning Board to act within 62 days of the determination of completeness will be deemed an approval of the application as submitted, except where this 62 day period is extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the City Planning Board.</li>
          <li>If the City Planning Board determines that the final plat is not in substantial agreement with the preliminary plat, the City Planning Board must hold a public hearing on the proposed final plat within 62 days of the determination of completeness. Notice of the public hearing is required in accordance with Section 11.2.2. Within 62 days of the closing of the public hearing, the City Planning Board must approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the application. The failure of the City Planning Board to act within 62 days of the closing of the public hearing will be deemed an approval of the application as submitted, except where this 62 day period is extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the City Planning Board.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1159-approval-standards">11.5.9 Approval Standards</h2>

<p>In approving, approving with modifications, or disapproving an application for a subdivision, the City Planning Board must make written findings of fact on the following criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The land shown on the plat will be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril
from fire, flood, drainage, or other menace to neighboring properties or the public health, safety, and welfare.</li>
  <li>The subdivision will ensure the accurate and easy description of land, orderly growth and development, efficient land use, and proper use of natural resources.</li>

      <li>Provide adequate access to a public or private right-of-way, or have access to such right-of-way with a permanent access easement.</li>
      <li>Be assigned street address numbers per Chapter 109 of the City Code.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Suitable monuments will be placed at block corners and other necessary points as may be required by the City Planning Board, with locations shown on the plat.</li>

system conforming to this Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan.</li>
  <li>All rights-of-way and other public places shown on the plat will be installed in accordance with standards, specifications, and procedures acceptable to the Buffalo Sewer Authority, Buffalo Water Board, Department of Public Works, Parks, and Streets, and Fire Department.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="11510-waivers">11.5.10 Waivers</h2>

<p>Where the City Planning Board finds that extraordinary hardships may result from strict compliance with these standards, it may waive these standards provided
that the adjustment is consistent with the intent and purpose of this Ordinance. In granting any adjustment, the City Planning Board may attach such conditions as are, in its judgment, necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements that are adjusted. This does not authorize the City Planning Board to waive any zoning standard for which a variance would be required.</p>

<h2 id="11511-modifications-to-approved-plats">11.5.11 Modifications to Approved Plats</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The moving of lot lines and rearrangement of easements are considered minor modifications and may be approved by the Zoning Administrator, provided that the lots meet the minimum requirements of this Ordinance and all other applicable regulations, and the number of lots remains the same. All other modifications are deemed major modifications and require resubmission of a preliminary plat.</li>
  <li>No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions may be made in any final plat after approval has been given by the City Planning Board and endorsed in writing on the plat, unless the Zoning Administrator deems the changes a minor modification.</li>
  <li>In the event that any such plat is recorded without complying with this requirement, the plat will be considered null and void, and the Zoning
Administrator must institute proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records of the County Clerk.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="11512-filing">11.5.12 Filing</h2>

<p>The issuance of either one of the following constitutes final approval of a plat, and will authorize the filing of the plat with the County Clerk:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The signature of the Chairman of the City Planning Board on the plat.</li>
  <li>The certificate of the City Clerk as to the date of the submission of the plat and the failure of the City Planning Board to take action within the prescribed time.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="11513-expiration">11.5.13 Expiration</h2>

<p>An approved subdivision expires 62 days from the date of the Chair’s signature constituting the approval of the plat, or from the date the certificate is issued, unless within the 62 day period the plat is filed or recorded by the subdivider in the office of the County Clerk.</p>

<h2 id="11514-survey-monuments">11.5.14 Survey Monuments</h2>

<p>Following final plat approval, survey monuments and markers must be laid out as indicated in the preliminary and final plats as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The permanent survey monuments must be installed within 30 days of notice from the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets and at the expense of the applicant.</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Monuments must be made of concrete cylinders covered with suitably marked bronze plates.</li>
      <li>The tops of the monuments and their location and grade must be set as established by the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets.</li>
      <li>The cylinders must be of sufficient depth to reach below the frost line.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets may modify or exempt this requirement based on the nature of the proposed subdivision.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="11515-reservation-of-parkland">11.5.15 Reservation of Parkland</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Before the City Planning Board may approve a subdivision plat containing residential units, the subdivision plat must also show, when required by the City Planning Board, a park or parks suitably located for playground or other recreational purposes.</li>
  <li>Land for park, playground, or other recreational purposes may not be required until the City Planning Board has made a finding that a proper case exists for requiring that a park or parks be suitably located for playgrounds or other recreational purposes within the City. These findings must include an evaluation of the present and anticipated future needs for park and recreational facilities in the City based on projected population growth to which the particular subdivision plat will contribute.</li>
  <li>If the City Planning Board makes a finding that the proposed subdivision plat presents a proper case for requiring a park or parks suitably located for playgrounds or other recreational purposes, but that a suitable park or parks of adequate size to meet the requirement cannot be properly located on the subdivision plat, the City Planning Board may require a sum of money in lieu thereof, in an amount to be established by the Common Council. In making the determination of suitability, the City Planning Board must assess the size and suitability of land shown on the subdivision plat which could be possible locations for park or recreational facilities, as well as practical factors including whether there is a need for additional facilities in the immediate neighborhood. Any money required by the City Planning Board in lieu of land for park, playground, or other recreational purposes must be deposited into a trust fund to be used by the City exclusively for park, playground, or other recreational purposes, including the acquisition of property.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="11516-required-improvements">11.5.16 Required Improvements</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Installation of Improvements. Within three years from the date of approval of the final plat, all improvements required by the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets, Buffalo Water Board, and Buffalo Sewer Authority must be made (designed, constructed, installed) by the subdivider at his/her expense. These improvements include, but are not limited to, roadway grading and pavement, sidewalks, curbs or gutters, sanitary sewers, water mains and services, stormwater management facilities, fire services, street lighting infrastructure, street name signs, and street trees.</li>
  <li>Notification. Prior to the start of construction of any required improvements, the applicant must furnish to the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets a copy of the specifications included in any contract entered Into by the applicant for construction. The applicant must notify the City at least five days prior to the start of construction or installation of any improvement and at least 24 hours prior to the completion of these improvements.</li>
  <li>Modification of Design of Improvements. If at any time before or during construction of the required public improvements it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets that unforeseen conditions make it necessary or preferable to modify the location or design of the required improvements, the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets may authorize modifications upon written request of the applicant, provided that the modifications are within the spirit and intent of the approved final plat and do not amount to the waiver or substantial alteration of the function of any required improvement. The Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets must issue any waiver in writing and transmit a copy of the waiver to the City Planning Board.</li>
  <li>Inspection of Improvements
    <ol>
      <li>The construction of all required improvements must be supervised by a New York State- licensed engineer employed by the City at the expense of the applicant. After completion of construction, the supervising engineer must certify to the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets that all required improvements have been constructed as required.</li>
      <li>The Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets must inspect required improvements during and at the completion of construction to ensure their satisfactory completion.</li>
      <li>If the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Street finds, upon inspection, that any of the required improvements have not been constructed per the approved plans and specifications, he/she must instruct the applicant to correct any discrepancies.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Default of Security Agreement. If any required improvements have not been installed as provided in this section within the term of a security agreement, the Common Council may declare the performance bond or security agreement to be in default and collect the sum remaining payable thereunder; and upon the receipt of the proceeds, the City must install the improvements as are covered by the security and as commensurate with the extent of building development that has taken place in the subdivision but not exceeding in cost the amount of such proceeds.</li>
  <li>Acceptance of Improvements
    <ol>
      <li>If any plat contains public rights-of-way, parks, or easements which are to be dedicated as such, the approval of the plat does not constitute an acceptance by the City of the improvements constructed or installed in the subdivision, irrespective of any acts by an officer, agent, or employee of the City with respect to these improvements.</li>
      <li>Every right-of-way, park, or easement shown on a plat filed or recorded in the office of the County Clerk will be deemed to be a private improvement until it has been formally dedicated and accepted by the City. Until such dedication and acceptance, the City is not responsible for maintenance.</li>
      <li>The acceptance of improvements may be made only by the adoption of a Common Council resolution after the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets files a certificate with the City Clerk certifying that all improvements have been constructed or installed as required. All accepted easements must be filed with the plat and copies forwarded to the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets.</li>
      <li>No reimbursement will be made by the City or any department or authority for the required improvements.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Modification of Security. If the City Planning Board decides at any time during the term of the performance bond or security agreement that the extent of building development that has taken place in the subdivision is not sufficient to warrant all the improvements covered by the security, or that the required improvements have been installed in accordance with this Ordinance in sufficient amount to warrant reduction in the amount of the security, and upon approval by the Common Council, the City Planning Board may modify its requirements for any or all such improvements, and the amount of such security must be reduced by an appropriate amount so that the new amount will cover the cost in full of the amended list of required improvements.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="11517-building-permits">11.5.17 Building Permits</h2>

<p>No building permit will be issued prior to the filing of the final plat with the County Clerk.</p>
